<!-- here we explain a small concept of screens -->
<!-- Where this approach surprises people most often is that to style something for mobile, 
    you need to use the unprefixed version of a utility, not the sm: prefixed version. 
    Don’t think of sm: as meaning “on small screens”, think of it as “at the small breakpoint“. -->
<!-- This will only center text on screens 640px and wider, not on small screens -->
<div class="bg-clifford  text-center">Hell0 </div>

<!-- This will center text on mobile and all screen size, and sm:text-left will align text left side for exact 640px and wider screen-->
